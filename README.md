### React Native Boilerplate with Native Base(UI Components framework RN)
- This project is boilerplate of React Native with Native Base.

#### Prerequisite:

1. Node.js: React Native is built using JavaScript, and you will need to have Node.js installed to use the React Native command-line tools. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) or through a package manager such as Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) on macOS.
2. Watchman: Watchman is a file watching service that is used by React Native to detect changes in your code and automatically rebuild and reload the app. You can install Watchman using Homebrew by running the following command:
 ```html
brew install watchman
```
3. Xcode: If you are developing for iOS, you will need to have Xcode installed on your Mac. Xcode is a development environment for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications, and it includes tools for building and debugging your app. You can download Xcode from the App Store or from the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
4. Android Studio: If you are developing for Android, you will need to have Android Studio installed on your machine. Android Studio is a development environment for Android applications, and it includes tools for building and debugging your app. You can download Android Studio from the official website (https://developer.android.com/studio/).
5. React Native CLI: The React Native command-line interface (CLI) is a tool that you will use to create and manage your React Native projects. To install the CLI, you can use npm (which comes with Node.js) by running the following command:
```html
npm install -g react-native-cli
```
- Once you have these dependencies installed, you should be ready to start developing your first React Native app!
